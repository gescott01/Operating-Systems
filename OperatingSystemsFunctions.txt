One function of an operating system is to turn the computer on. This can be sometimes done in a variety of ways. One way is the on/off button. Other times you may restart it with a series of commands while the computer is on.

Another function of the operating system is to provide a user interface. In modern times, most of us think of the user interface as what we would see on a Windows or Apple machine, a graphic user interface with clickable icons. However, many interfaces are command line interfaces, which requires a bit more knowledge to use, but gives the user more control over their environment.
